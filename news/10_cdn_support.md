We're excited to announce that PixelbiteCSS is now available via CDN through Jsdelivr! You can easily integrate PixelbiteCSS into your projects by linking to our CDN-hosted files from our separate repository [pixelbite-css/dist](https://github.com/pixelbite-css/dist).

## Continuing Support for Old Links
For those who have been using the old links for CSS and JS delivery in your projects, don't worry! We won't be cutting off the connection anytime soon. However, we encourage you to consider using our CDN for more stable and faster custom usage.

## Apology for the Silence
We apologize for the silence over the past few months. We understand the inconvenience caused by the lack of communication, and we want to assure you that we're still dedicated to delivering on our promises. While we've been mostly working in silence, rest assured that progress is being made behind the scenes.

## Change Log
Curious about what we've been up to? You can now explore our change log for PixelbiteCSS in the [dist repository](https://github.com/pixelbite-css/dist). We've been making updates and improvements to enhance your experience with PixelbiteCSS, and we're excited to share them with you.
