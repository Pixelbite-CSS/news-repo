Hello and welcome, everyone. This is me, @neostetic, speaking.

Yeah... sorry for not being active for the last couple of months. I've been busy working my real job as a graphic designer for a small company I won't mention. Sincerely sorry to those who thought I could push more updates to the site but couldn't :(

#### What's Cooking
Soooo...

I've been developing a huge update called 1.7. Not much has changed, but what I can tell you is that this update is going to be the biggest one I've ever committed to this project. There are **cookies**, **theme prefixes**, and **code inside an HTML**. Read more in the [changelog](https://github.com/Pixelbite-CSS/dist/tree/main/changelog).

The new update is coming really soon. I can't say exactly when, but expect it maybe by the end of this year :)

#### Sneak Peek?
Yes, you can now try the _alpha version_ from [here](https://github.com/Pixelbite-CSS/dist/tree/main) as an experimental version.

This might be shorter than usual since I've cut out the ChatGPT (I lied... everything was grammatically checked by GPT. luv ya, GPT :*)... where were we? Oh yes. I'll try to make more of these updates in the future. I like the branding to be more of a cool thingy since I'm cool as well... _haha..hah....ha........ yeaaaahhh. A bold statement an a bold project._

#### Well, Anyways
I'll keep you updated. Otherwise, you can follow me on the links provided on my GitHub page. You'll find it (I'm lazy :D).

Alright, cheers, and have a nice day.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
