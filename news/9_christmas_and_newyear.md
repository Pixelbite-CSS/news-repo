## ðŸŒŸ What's Coming in the New Year
### Better Enhanced and More Customizable Dropdown Menu
We're working on a major enhancement to the dropdown menu, making it even more versatile and customizable. Expect new features and design options to elevate your user interface.

### First Free Themes
In the spirit of giving, we'll be introducing our first set of free themes for PixelbiteCSS. These themes will serve as a starting point for your projects, allowing you to kickstart your designs with a festive touch.

### Customizable CSS Scripts in Components
To empower developers further, we're introducing the ability to include customizable CSS scripts within components. This includes support for loops, if statements, and more, giving you greater control over the styling of your web applications.

### Reworked Components
We're revisiting and reworking existing components to ensure they align seamlessly with the latest web development trends. This effort includes refining the design, improving performance, and expanding customization options.
