We are thrilled to announce the release of PixelbiteCSS version 1.6! This update brings several enhancements, fixes, and new features to improve your frontend development experience.

## Major Changes
### Improved Library Structure
- We have made significant improvements to the library's structure, resulting in a more efficient and maintainable codebase. Notably, we have deprecated the use of `pixelbite.update`, streamlining the library's internals for better performance and usability.

### Component Error Popup Fix
- The issue causing component error popups has been resolved. You can now enjoy a smoother development experience without interruptions.

### Dark Mode and _changeTheme()_ Fixes
- We have fixed issues related to Dark Mode and the `changeTheme()` function to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.

### Configs Support
- PixelbiteCSS now includes support for configuration files, making it easier to customize your development environment. Here are the key features of this enhancement:
    - **Improved Configuration Syntax:** We've introduced a more user-friendly and intuitive syntax for configuration files.
    - **Comment Support:** You can now add comments using `//` and `#` in your configuration files.
    - **Enhanced Configurations:** Enjoy extended support for various configurations and Font Awesome integration.
    - **Custom Name Components:** Define custom names for components in your configurations.

### Font Awesome Support
- We have added built-in support for Font Awesome icons. You can customize the icon link by modifying `pixelbite.fontawesome` to suit your project's needs.

### Pixelbite Object Restructure
- The structure of the Pixelbite object has been updated for improved clarity and organization.

### _allocatedPath()_ Function
- We've introduced the `allocatedPath()` function, allowing you to replace `@/` strings with your site's URL. This simplifies path management and makes it easier to handle URLs.

- Additionally, object attributes are now structured as `object_name:object` for consistency and ease of use.
