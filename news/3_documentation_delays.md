We want to express our sincere gratitude for your interest and support in PixelbiteCSS, our open-source frontend development framework. We value your commitment to our project and want to address a few important matters.

## Documentation Delays
We understand that comprehensive and up-to-date documentation is crucial for a seamless development experience. We apologize for any delays in completing and maintaining our documentation. Please know that we are a team of volunteers, working on this project during our free time. While we are passionate about improving PixelbiteCSS and providing you with the best tools, our availability is limited.

We are actively working on improving our documentation, but it may take some time to catch up with the latest features and changes in the framework. Your patience and understanding mean the world to us, and we are committed to delivering high-quality documentation as soon as possible.

## Supporting PixelbiteCSS
To ensure the sustainability of our open-source project, we are considering the possibility of adding a donation system. These donations would go directly toward funding the project's development, server costs, and other associated expenses.

By donating, you can help us allocate more time and resources to the project, accelerate development, and provide better support, including faster documentation updates.

We want to emphasize that PixelbiteCSS will always remain open source and free to use for everyone. Donations, if implemented, will be entirely voluntary and used to support the project's growth and maintenance.

Your input on this matter is invaluable to us. We'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions regarding donations or any other ways you believe we can improve PixelbiteCSS.

Thank you for being a part of our community and for your continued support. Together, we can make PixelbiteCSS even better for all frontend developers.

Stay tuned for updates, and please feel free to [contact us](https://github.com/orgs/Pixelbite-CSS/people) if you have any questions or feedback.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
